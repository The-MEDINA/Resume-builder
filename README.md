# Resume-builder

ok ok ok so like
the goal of this project is a few things:

* Make this for CSH
* Make this a web app so write it in JavaScript n stuff (cries)
* make it take in data to build the resume so you just have to slide something in and not mess with the code
* make it generate a PDF
* make filters so you can sort by only what you wanna see & what's relavant
* DON'T MAKE IT LOOK SO BORING UGHHHH
* functional (optional)
* New idea let people leave a link to resumes they made with this on their own places

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
