# Resume-builder

ok ok ok so like
the goal of this project is a few things:

* Make this for CSH
* Make this a web app so write it in JavaScript n stuff (cries)
* make it take in data to build the resume so you just have to slide something in and not mess with the code
* make it generate a PDF
* make filters so you can sort by only what you wanna see & what's relavant
* DON'T MAKE IT LOOK SO BORING UGHHHH
* functional (optional)
* New idea let people leave a link to resumes they made with this on their own places
